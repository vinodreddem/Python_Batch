Q.Django Migration problem
	Suppose DB is up to date but the migrations has new increments. New incremental migration has scripts which says add , alter remove fields but all the operations are already done in the DB. When trying to make any other changes to models and trying to migrate Django keeps throwing an error saying duplicate column when trying to add or column does not exist if it is already removed. What are the ways to overcome this

Q. REST API Caching -- designing from server side
	You are developing a Microservice, which serves fairly static data using REST API. For example, details about the Patents filed. Let's assume you have an API to get details about the patent filed; such as GET ./patentDetails/PATENTID/


Q. Python Django question: URL mapping
	Let's say you have a REST API to GET details of a specific student from the server that runs Django.

Q. How will you map the URL to the implementation? Note that the API must be authenticated

a = a -b //20

Method: 2
---------
a, b = b, a

Method 3:
--------- 
temp = a
a = b
b = temp

Q. example given the string "Welcome to the danger zone" should become "zone danger the to Welcome" and not "enoz regnad eht ot emocleW"?

Q. You are given a string input, let's say "Hello World!". Your output should be, how many times each character is showing up in the string. So, in this example, it should write:

H: 1 e: 1 l: 3 o: 2

Q. Print a given array in a loop to output the desired pattern
Input length of an array, the array, number of characters in a group and number of groups. Print the array cyclically in a loop.

Length-6
Array-[1,2,3,4,5,6]
Group- 4
Iterations- 7
Prints

['1', '2', '3', '4']
['5', '6', '1', '2']
['3', '4', '5', '6']
['1', '2', '3', '4']
['5', '6', '1', '2']
['3', '4', '5', '6']
['1', '2', '3', '4']
